## Description

The `metafor` package is a comprehensive collection of functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package includes functions to calculate various effect sizes or outcome measures, fit fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models to such data, carry out moderator and meta-regression analyses, and create various types of meta-analytical plots (e.g., forest, funnel, radial, L'Abb√©, Baujat, GOSH plots). For meta-analyses of binomial and person-time data, the package also provides functions that implement specialized methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's method, and a variety of suitable generalized linear (mixed-effects) models (i.e., mixed-effects logistic and Poisson regression models). Finally, the package provides functionality for fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel models that account for non-independent sampling errors and/or true effects (e.g., due to the inclusion of multiple treatment studies, multiple endpoints, or other forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses and meta-analyses accounting for known correlation structures (e.g., due to phylogenetic relatedness) can also be conducted.

## Documentation

A good starting place for those interested in using the `metafor` package is the following paper:

Viechtbauer, W. (2010). Conducting meta-analyses in R with the metafor package. *Journal of Statistical Software, 36*(3), 1-48. [https://www.jstatsoft.org/v36/i03/](https://www.jstatsoft.org/v36/i03/).

In addition to reading the paper, carefully read the [package intro](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/metafor-package.html) and then the help pages for the [`escalc`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/escalc.html) and the [`rma.uni`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/rma.uni.html) functions (or the [`rma.mh`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/rma.mh.html), [`rma.peto`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/rma.peto.html), [`rma.glmm`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/rma.glmm.html), [`rma.mv`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/rma.mv.html) functions if you intend to use these methods). The help pages for these functions provide links to many additional functions, which can be used after fitting a model. You can also read the entire documentation online at [https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/) (where it is nicely formatted, equations are shown correctly, and the output from all examples is provided).

## Installation

The current official (i.e., [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=metafor)) release can be installed within R with:
```r
install.packages("metafor")
```

The development version of the package can be installed with:
```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wviechtb/metafor")
```
This builds the package from source based on the current version on [GitHub](https://github.com/wviechtb/metafor).
